# Simple Messenger

A simple messaging application built with Flutter.

## Introduction

Simple Messenger is a Flutter application designed to provide users with a very simplistic messaging application, allowing real-time communication with friends and family. Allowing for both email-password and Google sign-in through Firebase authentication, users are also able to add any existing users as friends and start sending messages.

This Flutter app works in tandem with [Simple Messenger Go](https://github.com/anthonydip/flutter-messenger) running as the backend server.

Created as a learning project to learn and practice Flutter, along with implementing API calls and utilizing a cloud database.
